# --- Appearance & Fonts ---
theme = Catppuccin Mocha
font-family = "JetBrains Mono"
font-size = 14

# Adjust cursor to be a block that stops blinking
cursor-style = block
cursor-style-blink = true

# --- Cross-Platform Titlebar Hiding ---
# macOS: Hides the bar but keeps the "traffic lights" if you hover (or use 'hidden' to remove fully)
#macos-titlebar-style = tabs
# Linux: Disables server-side window decorations
#window-decoration = false
# Linux (GNOME specific): Ensures the header bar is gone
#gtk-titlebar = false

# --- Window Behavior ---
window-padding-x = 4
window-padding-y = 4
# Start new windows/tabs in the same directory as the current one
#working-directory = inherit

# --- Keybindings (The "Muscle Memory" Section) ---

# 1. Vim-Style Split Navigation (Works on both)
# Using Ctrl+h/j/k/l to move between splits
#keybind = ctrl+h=goto_split:left
#keybind = ctrl+j=goto_split:bottom
#keybind = ctrl+k=goto_split:top
#keybind = ctrl+l=goto_split:right

# 2. Resizing Splits
# macOS: Cmd+Ctrl+Arrow
#keybind = cmd+ctrl+left=resize_split:left,20
#keybind = cmd+ctrl+right=resize_split:right,20
#keybind = cmd+ctrl+up=resize_split:up,20
#keybind = cmd+ctrl+down=resize_split:down,20
# Linux: Alt+Shift+Arrow (Alternative since Cmd is Super on Linux)
#keybind = alt+shift+left=resize_split:left,20
#keybind = alt+shift+right=resize_split:right,20
#keybind = alt+shift+up=resize_split:up,20
#keybind = alt+shift+down=resize_split:down,20

# 3. Tab Management
# Standardize "New Tab" if you want consistency
# Ghostty defaults are usually fine (Cmd+T on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+T on Linux)
# But here is how to force Alt+Enter to open a new tab on BOTH:
keybind = ctrl+shift+t=new_tab
keybind = ctrl+]=next_tab
keybind = ctrl+[=previous_tab

# 4. Reload Config (Useful when tweaking this file)
keybind = ctrl+shift+r=reload_config
keybind = cmd+shift+r=reload_config

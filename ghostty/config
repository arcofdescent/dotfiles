# --- Keybindings (The "Muscle Memory" Section) ---

# 1. Vim-Style Split Navigation (Works on both)
#keybind = cmd+d=noop
keybind = ctrl+shift+o=new_split:right
keybind = ctrl+shift+e=new_split:down

# Using Ctrl+h/j/k/l to move between splits
keybind = ctrl+shift+h=goto_split:left
keybind = ctrl+shift+j=goto_split:bottom
keybind = ctrl+shift+k=goto_split:top
keybind = ctrl+shift+l=goto_split:right

# 2. Resizing Splits
# macOS: Cmd+Ctrl+Arrow
keybind = cmd+ctrl+left=resize_split:left,20
keybind = cmd+ctrl+right=resize_split:right,20
keybind = cmd+ctrl+up=resize_split:up,20
keybind = cmd+ctrl+down=resize_split:down,20

# 3. Tab Management
# Standardize "New Tab" if you want consistency
# Ghostty defaults are usually fine (Cmd+T on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+T on Linux)
# But here is how to force Alt+Enter to open a new tab on BOTH:
keybind = ctrl+shift+t=new_tab
keybind = ctrl+]=next_tab
keybind = ctrl+[=previous_tab

# 4. Reload Config (Useful when tweaking this file)
keybind = cmd+shift+r=reload_config
